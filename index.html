    <p>Scene design: Boy at the waters edge</p>
    <p>This scene in particular is one where the player is first met with a change in atmosphere. The boy walks out from a dense forest out to a cove at the edge of a body of water. At the edge of the body of water is a boat. The choices that Playdead made in designing this scene are deliberately made to create a sense of vastness to this world they are creating.</p>

    <p><b>Color Palette</b></p>
    <IMG SRC= "boy at the waters edge palette.png" >
    
    <p style="line-height:1.4">While the color palette is limited to a completely monotone palette, the use of value in this scene (and others like it) is a crucial element in creating the atmosphere. The transition from the mid-dark values to a giant space of the second lightest color in the whole palette, isn't easy on the eyes. It is our first major introduction to a major light source. We can assume it is the sun peeking in to an opening in this cavern like structure from looking at the subtle darkening of the values as it comes closer to us in the playing field. Without these background elements, the scene would feel flat and unengaging. But because the designers at Playdead chose to use the values in this way, the scene had an enormous amount of depth in it's environment.</p>

    <p><b>The Raft</b>></p>
    <IMG SRC= "boy on the boat.png">

    <p style="line-height:1.4">The design and look of the boat affects the feel of the scene as well. It is a small meek-looking structure with a sail-less mast in the center. It is slightly rocking back and forth in the still water. I think that Playdead's choice to leave the sail off of the boat was a choice in designing the atmosphere of this scene. Visually, if it were to appear as a typical sailboat, I feel it would take up the spotlight as the star of the show. Without the sail, it creates the illusion of an open environment. When you jump onto the raft, you land on it with a small thud and it sails out into seemingly boundless waters. </p>

    <p><b>The Boy's Reaction</b>></p>
   <IMG SRC= "boy reaction.png">

    <p style ="line-height:1.4">The boy's reaction to the change in his environment are subtle but still important in immersing the player in the game's environment. As he settles in the boat for a second as it moves to the right, if you stand still, he lifts his head and stares out into the sky. His curious demeanor adds to the sense of adventure in the game. </p>
